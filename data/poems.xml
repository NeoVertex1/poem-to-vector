Mysteries veiled by the fading light,

While night’s embrace binds heart to sight,
Threads of time in soft moonlight.

A woven dream of night starts its slow dance,

Whispered secrets in shades of fading light,
Echo through realms where silence takes a stance.

Moonlight casts its gentle, silver arc,
As shadows weave beneath the calm they scheme,

With every beam, memories softly stir,
And dreams are painted with a silver gleam.</new_poem>
